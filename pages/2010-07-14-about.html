Hello, everybody! My name is Parker Higgins, and this is my website. I am a guy who's interested in the theory and practice of copyright, and how it interacts with creativity. I'm an enthusiast and activist for free software and free culture. To that end I have served on the board of the international student group <a href="http://freeculture.org">Students for Free Culture,</a> and I proudly use and support as much free software as I can.

I also like public transportation systems and their maps, kite aerial photography, vegetarian food, good science fiction, and sweaters. I enjoy playing the ukulele (especially concert) and singing karaoke (especially "Western-style," in large rooms). I'm interested in unusual typography, and particularly like the look of the reversed pilcrow (⁋) and the interrobang (‽).

I am a 2010 graduate of NYU Gallatin, where I concentrated in Creativity, Freedom of Speech and Intellectual Property. I have since moved to Berlin, where I now live and work. I can be found in many places around the internet; an incomplete list of those places can be found in the <a href="http://parkerhiggins.net/contact">Contact</a> section.
