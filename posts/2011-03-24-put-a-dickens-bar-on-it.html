Inspired by a <a href="http://thedickbar.com" target="_blank">handful</a> <a href="http://putadickbaronit.com" target="_blank">of sites</a> that have popped up in the last few weeks to mock a <a href="http://dickbar.org" target="_blank">design change</a> made in the official Twitter app for iPhone, my buddies <a href="http://robb.is" target="_blank">Robb</a> and <a href="http://johndadams.com" target="_blank">Johnny</a> and I have put together a project called <a href="http://thedickensbar.com" target="_blank">the Dickens Bar</a>. The idea is simple â€” enter the URL of any website, and see it immediately enhanced by the "trending topics" of one of the most popular English novelists of the Victorian Era. See, for example, <a href="http://thedickensbar.com/goto/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fparkerhiggins.net" target="_blank">this very site with Dickens Bar addition</a>.
