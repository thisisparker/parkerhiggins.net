Since it was introduced, the SoundCloud Record button has been hard to get to work in Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux distributions. Fortunately, my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/omidaladini">Omid</a>, who is a SoundCloud developer, has found a solution.

It turns out the problem is caused by a "Linux-specific security feature" (read: <a href="https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-1211">bug</a> [login required]) that prevents a Flash settings dialogue from appearing when wmode=opaque is used. In any case, there are a few easy workarounds.

If you've got the flash-player-properties package installed (which, at least on Ubuntu, ships separately from the flash-plugin, but is available in the standard repositories), you can add "a1.sndcdn.com" to the allowed sites under the "Camera & Mic" tab of that program.

Otherwise, if you've unsuccessfully attempted to record at least once on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/upload">the SoundCloud upload page</a>, you can add a1.sndcdn.com from the Flash player's <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html">web settings panel</a>. While you're there, check your security settings!

Hope this is helpful to other SoundCloud users on Linux who haven't quite been able to get recording working.
