The first week of the new year: time to make resolutions about the sort of person you want to be, and the sorts of behaviors you want to have. Go to the gym, blog more, that sort of thing.

Of course, these promises don't usually pan out on the strength of the resolution alone; you need a bit of a carrot and/or a stick to make you stick to it.

So it's in that spirit that I introduce the <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com">San Francisco chapter of Iron Blogger</a>. Inspired by Mako's <a href="http://iron-blogger.mako.cc/">Iron Blogger in Boston</a>, and joining <a href="http://www.thewavingcat.com/2011/12/25/im-joining-iron-blogger-berlin/">my friends</a> <a href="http://michellethorne.cc/2011/12/iron-blogger-berlin/">Iron-Blogging</a> <a href="http://www.antischokke.de/2011/12/18/ich-werde-iron-bloggerin-echt-jetzt/">in Berlin</a>, I decided it was time to put some skin (or at least a few dollars) into the blogging game.

In case you don't know <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com/the-rules">the rules of Iron Blogger</a>: every participant must post something to her blog every week. If she fails, she owes the organizer $5. (That's the stick.) Once enough money has been collected, everybody goes out and gets beer with it. (That's the carrot.) I've gotten a <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com/participants">group of friends</a> together to start, and if you're in San Francisco and interested in participating, <a href="http://parkerhiggins.net/contact/">let me know</a>.

I'm looking forward to it!
