Over on the SoundCloud blog, I've got <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2010/08/11/cross-genre-composer-solo-goodspeed-schizo-brainiac/">a user profile up</a> of the musician <a href="http://soundcloud.com/schizo-brainiac">Solo Goodspeed</a>. He's a very nice guy, and his music is really interesting and eclectic, reminiscent (in a very good way) of some of the more symphonic Frank Zappa pieces. Some neat insights come out in the interview, and I really enjoyed talking with him. Here's his track "Delirium Trimmings," which is cool.
