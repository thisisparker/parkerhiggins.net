I've been impressed with the quality of language used to describe the Stop Online Piracy Act. The bill is a disaster for the internet, and its opponents are devising some pretty creative ways of expressing that. Two of my favorites:

From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/stop-sopa/2011/11/16/gIQAlEtNSN_blog.html">Alexandra Petri on the Washington Post ComPost blog</a>:
<blockquote>This isn't even throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is bludgeoning the baby repeatedly with a sledgehammer and then throwing out the whole bathroom.</blockquote>

From <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/say-no-to-sopa/">Jeffrey Zeldman on A List Apart</a>:
<blockquote>SOPA approaches the piracy problem with a broad brush, lights that brush on fire, and soaks the whole internet in gasoline.</blockquote>

<strong>UPDATE: Dec 9</strong>: From the great <a href="http://ammori.org/2011/12/08/controversial-copyright-bills-would-violate-first-amendment-letters-to-congress-by-laurence-tribe-and-me/">Marvin Ammori</a>, on his letter with Laurence Tribe:
<blockquote>The bills are not limited; they’re sledgehammers not scalpels.</blockquote>

<strong>UPDATE: Dec 13</strong>: From <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/the-new-sopa-now-with-slightly-less-awfulness/">Julian Sanchez at the Cato Institute</a>:
<blockquote>A third clause says the bill shouldn’t be construed in a way that would impair the security or integrity of the network—which is a bit like slapping a label on a cake stipulating that it shouldn’t be construed to make you fat.</blockquote>

From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/nbepe/sopa_in_a_nutshell_if_a_criminal_hid_counterfeit/">user roxtafari on Reddit</a>:
<blockquote>SOPA in a nutshell: If a criminal hid counterfeit goods in a bank safe deposit box, SOPA would allow the legitimate IP owner to shut down the entire bank and all other branches without any notice, search warrant, or due process.</blockquote>

<strong>UPDATE: Dec 18</strong>: From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/everything-you-need-to-know-about-congresss-online-piracy-bills-in-one-post/2011/12/16/gIQAz4ggyO_blog.html">Brad Plumer on Washington Post's Wonkblog</a>:
<blockquote>Essentially, copyright holders are asking for a really enormous sledgehammer to play this game of whack-a-mole.</blockquote>

I'll keep updating as I come across good ones, and let me know in the comments if you've seen one.
