Der Spiegel has posted on their website <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,710976,00.html">an official English version</a> of <a href="../2010/08/knowledge-explosion-in-translation-from-der-spiegel/">that article that I translated last week</a>. Interesting to compare and contrast: the official translation is more confident (i.e. more willing to deviate from the original structures and phrases in order to improve flow) and consistent with tenses, but there aren't any significant differences in meaning.
