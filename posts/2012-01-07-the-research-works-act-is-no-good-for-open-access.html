The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3699:">Research Works Act (HR 3699)</a> is a new bill introduced to the House of Representatives by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY). As the name suggests, the bill addresses research â€” specifically the academic research that's subsidized by the US government with tens of billions of dollars annually. Contrary to the name, though, it isn't something that works. At least, it doesn't work for the public interest.

The bill is short enough to fit on one page and is pretty readable. In essence, it says the government cannot "adopt, implement, maintain, continue, or otherwise engage in" any policy or program that allows or requires "private-sector research work" to be released in an open access journal or repository.

As is typical with such legislation, though, the devil's in the details. What constitutes a "private-sector research work"? Check the definitions section to see that it includes "research funded in whole or in part by a Federal agency", as long as a publisher has made any sort of value add, such as peer review or editing. That's right: research funded completely by taxpayer dollars can be deemed "private-sector" as soon as peer reviewers (who are sometimes public employees, and usually working voluntarily!) examine it. In other words, one drop of commercial publisher sludge, no matter how diluted, can poison the whole public research well.

This bill, unsurprisingly supported by the <a href="http://www.publishers.org/">Association of American Publishers</a>, takes direct aim at open access journals and repositories in general, and the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">National Institute of Health's PubMed Central</a> in particular. PubMed Central is populated with articles that build on publicly funded research, which makes sense; after all, we as taxpayers paid for the research, why shouldn't we have access to it? But the Research Works Act sets up a system where <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/doing-good-science/2012/01/06/the-research-works-act-asking-the-public-to-pay-twice-for-scientific-knowledge/">the public pays twice, and publishers keep the difference</a>.

If the sponsor Darrell Issa sounds familiar to Free Culture-ites, it's likely because of the good work he's done standing <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57342716-281/rep-issa-sopa-wont-be-approved-unless-fixed/">against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA, HR 3261)</a> and for <a href="http://keepthewebopen.com/">legislative transparency</a>. That makes his support for this bill <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-is-open-internet-champion-darrell-issa-supporting-an-attack-on-open-science/250929/">all the more confusing</a>. Because championing the "integrity of peer-reviewed" work is a laudable cause, but throwing the public interest under the bus is not the way to do it.

The House of Representatives is currently on winter holiday, but they'll be back later this month and need to hear from you. Students, librarians, professors, and researchers can have a big impact in stopping this bill. (In fact, libraries and universities were instrumental in stopping earlier versions of this legislation.)

The Alliance for Taxpayer Access, a project of SPARC, has put together <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/action/action_access/12-0106.shtml">an Action Center to let you contact your representative</a> and tell them to stand against this bill. Please take action today to keep public research a public good!
