"<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/12/13/universities-intellectual-copyright-unauthorized/">A  Sensible Compromise</a>," an editorial published in the Harvard Crimson  last week, described the actions of the MPAA in urging universities like  Harvard to develop a "written plan to effectively combat the  unauthorized distribution of copyright material by users" of the  university network in compliance with the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/node/645/tid/34600?time=1292885674">Higher Education Opportunity  Act of 2008</a>. The Crimson's take, as suggested by the title, is that  these actions and the law that supports them are reasonable and  justified.

The  evidence for the Crimson's claim is shaky, based largely on two  sweeping claims about intellectual property. The Crimson states as  common sense that without an effective intellectual property regime,  there will be no incentive for innovation.

But around  the world there are well documented examples of innovation and  creativity that function in the absence of strong copyright protection:  the world's second largest movie industry, in Nigeria, and the booming "techno brega" scene in Brazil were both documented in the  documentary "<a href="http://www.goodcopybadcopy.net/">Good Copy Bad Copy</a>," which is <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6022610/Good_Copy_Bad_Copy">available for free online</a>.  And that's to say nothing of all of the innovations that took place  before the mid-1700s, the works of Mozart, Shakespeare, Michelangelo,  and all the others that lived before modern copyright was developed.  Lastly, enormous areas of creativity like fashion, cooking, comedy, and  even magic tricks operate without copyright protection. Closer to home,  the entire academic publishing system functions without authors  retaining copyright for their works, instead exchanging their monopoly for  the opportunity to publish. Copyright can certainly provide a motivation  for entrepreneurs to create, but in light of these examples, The  Crimson's statement that the absence of IP laws would eliminate  innovation seems unjustifiable.

The  second overbroad claim in the editorial pertains to a concept called  "moral rights." "Intellectual property rights are important," according  to the Crimson, "because each person has a fundamental right to enjoy  the fruits of his or her mental labor." The fact is that that  justification is not uncommon in parts of the world, but has no  basis in American law. The Constitutional "copyright clause," in fact,  is the only right enumerated in the Constitution with an explicit  purpose, and that purpose is incentivization: Congress may secure monopolies for creators in order  "<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Copyright_Clause">to promote the progress of science and the useful arts</a>." No less than  Thomas Jefferson was uncomfortable with the "<a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html">embarrassment</a>" of  monopolies, but conceded that as an incentive, they might be worthwhile.  As a fundamental moral right? He never even considered it.

Finally,  the editorial talks about the concept of "balance," and then gets into a  discussion of business models, debating whether the ones that exist  today are convenient enough to remove the justification for piracy. This  discussion is an interesting one, and has a place elsewhere, but let's not confuse an economic argument with an ideological one. In the world's premiere institution of higher learning—and truly, in any institution of higher learning—the balance isn't a question of business models.  Should Harvard University, at the urging of a media industry that  presumes the students to be criminals, reduce the flow of information  available to them?

The  MPAA and similar organizations are comfortable to disregard the  educational benefits that technology has brought us and to see the  Harvard student body as a group of potential criminal freeloaders. One  can sympathize with members of the movie industry which, in spite of consistently <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/01/what-piracy-movie-biz-sees-record-box-office-in-2008.ars"> breaking annual box office records</a>, purports to be having a hard time.  And it's certainly reasonable for a university to discuss what the legal and technical guidelines  of its network ought to be. But it's wrong to kowtow to the demands of a  media industry at the cost of Harvard students' technological autonomy.
