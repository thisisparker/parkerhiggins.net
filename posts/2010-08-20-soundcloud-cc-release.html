I'm very proud to have been involved with <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2010/08/19/reuse-soundcloud-style/">SoundCloud's major feature release</a> today, which includes (among other awesome things, like <a href="http://soundcloud.com/tags">a track tag explore page</a>) deeper integration and support for Creative Commons licenses. Among the changes were the addition of prominent CC badges to track players, the development of <a href="http://soundcloud.com/creativecommons">a CC landing page</a>, and the long-awaited introduction of <a href="http://soundcloud.com/tracks/search?advanced=1&amp;q[cc_licensed]=1&amp;q[model]=Track">advanced search</a>--including, naturally, search-by-license-type.

I was also <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23018">interviewed on the Creative Commons blog</a> to talk about this latest move by SoundCloud.

I really think SoundCloud has what it takes to be the Flickr of audio, and their commitment to free culture and free software has been extremely commendable. (The site uses Flash, but has developed an experimental HTML5 player, as well as <a href="http://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-remix">numerous</a> <a href="http://wiki.github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-custom-player/">other</a> <a href="http://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-social-download">free</a> <a href="http://github.com/soundcloud">software projects</a>.) It's really an exciting organization to be working with!
