<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/14/opinion/essay-sink-the-clipper-chip.html">William Safire's 1994 response to the Clipper chip works</a> as a smart and poignant response to the Obama administration's reported proposal to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/us/27wiretap.html">weaken encryption so "secure" communications can be wiretapped</a>. The Safire piece is too good and too short to excerpt.

The story of the "crypto wars" and the Clipper chip in the 80s and 90s is a really interesting one, and worth looking over. Steven Levy's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crypto-Rebels-Government-Privacy-Digital/dp/0140244328/ref=sr_1_1?s=gateway&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1285744053&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Crypto</em></a> is a great book that addresses it, and it's a fun and informative read. If you're more into primary sources, articles about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/16/us/electronics-plan-aims-to-balance-government-access-with-privacy.html">the Clipper's introduction</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/09/business/technology-wrestling-over-the-key-to-the-codes.html">problematic development</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/21/business/gore-shifts-stance-on-chip-code.html">ultimate defeat</a> are all worth reading, and should be required for anybody thinking about the current proposal.
