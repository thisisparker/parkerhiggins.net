My friend <a href="http://partickhammer.com">Patrick Hammer</a> sent around a video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFDoCLf96Kg&amp;feature=view_all&amp;list=PL12756B00285CCCD1&amp;index=1">Rebecca MacKinnon's TED talk</a> about the need for users to take back the Internet. It's a great talk, and it reminded me of how effective the TED talk format can be at communicating complex ideas to people who don't want to dive into a monograph or two.

I decided to put together some of the best TED talks I've seen that address, somehow, the concept of free culture. Obviously there's some subjective selection here, and I'm taking submissions, but I think this playlist is a good start.

I'd like to include Lawrence Lessig's talk on "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q25-S7jzgs">How creativity is being strangled by the law</a>", but wouldn't you know it, the video's blocked by GEMA in Germany and I can't add it to a playlist. You can't make this stuff up.

Let me know what others you'd include!
